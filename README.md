## Introduction

Hey, I'm Eddy!

I'm the product designer at [Tenki](https://www.tenki.cloud/), a start-up focused on making your GitHub Actions more efficient so you can save money and run workflows even faster. 

You can also find me making contributions to my portfolio. I see my website as the digital representation of myself on the World Wide Web. I seek to document my journey as a designer. As such, I make frequent updates. I started my current [portfolio](https://eddypeng.com/) on December 17, 2021 using HTML and CSS. Since then, I've consistently iterated on it.

I'm currently redesigning the website and using Next.js for the development because it would give me more control over how I organize my code. This is my [new portfolio](https://eddy-portfolio-staging.vercel.app/) so far. I still need to do a lot of work, but I've been enjoying it. Can't wait to see what new directions I take it!
